    <p>Benjamin Kores is a Computer Science Major at the College of Staten Island in Staten Island, NY and graduated
        from Staten Island Technical High
        School in 2019. He discovered his love of cooking at the age of 7, when he helped his mother bake chocolate chip
        cookies for the very first time.
        Ever since then, he cooked and baked whenever he could, challenging himself to do more and more without the help
        of his mother, who is an excellent chef herself, and to
        come up with more and more innovative and delicious recipes. Ben's other hobbies include swimming, coding,
        theater, and watching movies and TV.
        He was on the Trident Aquatics Club Swim Team at the JCC in Staten Island for over 10 years and was on the
        Staten Island Tech swim team, and won
        multiple gold medals at swim meets. Ben's love of coding manifested when he got his first Android tablet at the
        age of 12. He was fascinated by how the software worked and was obssessed
        with figuring it out. Now he is proficient in Java, Python, and MySQL Server, and hopes to be a software
        developer at a major tech company like Google, preferably
        for mobile app development. Ben is also a huge theater nerd. He loves to act and sing and performed in many
        middle school and high school plays.
        If his software career doesn't pan out, he hopes to enter the theater industry. Ben is also a huge Marvel and DC
        fan and loves to watch comic book movies and TV shows
        whenever he gets the chance. </p>
